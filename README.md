![bike](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa02bd3-a59d-4b27-b5eb-8f1d3b91a3d1)


## Project Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to bike brands, products, customers, orders, and inventory. The goal is to derive meaningful insights, such as identifying top customers, analyzing product performance, and evaluating store performance. The analysis is performed using Power BI.

   - `last_name`
   - `phone`
   - `email`
   - `street`
   - `city`
   - `state`
   - `zip_code`

4. **orders.csv**
   - `order_id`
   - `customer_id`
   - `order_status`
   - `order_date`
   - `required_date`
   - `shipped_date`
   - `store_id`
   - `staff_id`

5. **order_items.csv**
   - `order_id`

   - `store_id`
   - `manager_id`

8. **stocks.csv**
   - `store_id`
   - `product_id`
   - `quantity`

9. **stores.csv**
   - `store_id`

## Key Analysis and Insights

1. **Top Customers**:
   - Identify the top 5 customers generating the highest revenue.

2. **Product Performance**:
   - Analyze the most and least popular products based on sales and revenue.

3. **Store Performance**:
   - Evaluate the revenue generated by each store and identify the best-performing locations.

4. **Inventory Analysis**:
   - Analyze stock levels and identify products that need restocking.

5. **Order Trends**:
   - Examine trends in order volume and revenue over time.

## Data Transformation to Data Modeling

### **Step 1: Data Loading**
1. Import all `.csv` files into Power BI.
2. Ensure correct file paths and formats during import.

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning**
1. Use Power Query to:
   - Remove unnecessary columns.
   - Rename columns for better readability.
   - Fix missing or incorrect data (e.g., null values, inconsistent formats).

### **Step 3: Data Transformation**
1. Create calculated columns and measures as needed:
   - Example: Calculate revenue for each order using the formula:
     ```DAX
     Revenue = (order_items[quantity] * order_items[list_price]) - order_items[discount]
     ```
2. Convert data types (e.g., ensure dates are in proper `Date` format).
3. Split or merge columns if necessary (e.g., full names split into first and last names).

### **Step 4: Data Modeling**
1. Establish relationships between tables:
   - Link `orders.csv` to `customers.csv` via `customer_id`.
   - Link `order_items.csv` to `orders.csv` via `order_id`.
   - Link `products.csv` to `order_items.csv` via `product_id`.
   - Link `stocks.csv` to `stores.csv` and `products.csv`.

2. Set relationship cardinalities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).
3. Enable referential integrity where applicable.

### **Step 5: Build the Data Model**
1. Create a star schema for efficient querying.
2. Add calculated measures for KPIs, such as:
   - Total Revenue
   - Total Orders
   - Average Order Value

### **Step 6: Test the Model**
1. Validate relationships by creating test visualizations (e.g., linking orders to customers).
2. Check for duplicate or mismatched data.
